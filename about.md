Hey there! I'm Abhinand. I'm a computer systems engineer by day and I like to tinker around with linux, computers and other software. Someday, I wish to learn about electronics, chip design and machine learning. I expect to fill this blog mostly with the things I find intresting, thoughts and notes that I can come back to later.

Thanks for reading!
